# The 24/7 Founder: Living the High-Intensity Startup Life

We’ve all seen the LinkedIn posts about the "hustle," but there’s a massive difference between reading about it and living it. For the past year and a half, I’ve been part of a small, four-person unit at Shiboleth.ai. In a group that tight, you see everything. What I see every single day (and every single weekend) are a CEO and CTO who simply do not stop.

Our leadership team puts in 10 to 12 hours a day, seven days a week. In 18 months, I haven't seen our CTO take a full day off. When your founders operate at that intensity, it changes the entire molecular structure of the engineering team.

If you are in the trenches with "always-on" leadership, here is the reality of the pros and cons.

## The Pros

### 1. Zero-Lag Leadership

In a group of four engineers, bottlenecks are the enemy. When leadership is always online, "waiting for a review" isn't a thing. This velocity is addictive. We’re building AI compliance tools in a space that moves fast, and our founders' availability allows us to ship at a pace that larger companies can't touch.

### 2. High Technical Empathy

Because the CTO is constantly in the weeds, they know exactly why a specific LLM implementation is acting up or why a database migration is risky. You aren't reporting to "suits" who don't understand the tech; you’re working with practitioners. This means less time explaining problems and more time solving them.

### 3. Absolute Accountability

It is hard to feel unmotivated when the people at the top are in the code with you at 9:00 PM on a Sunday. It creates a culture of mutual respect. You know that if the ship starts taking on water, they are the ones plugging the leaks, not heading for the lifeboats.

## The Cons

### 1. The "Phantom" Pressure

Even if a CEO says, "Take your weekend," seeing them active on Slack on a Sunday morning creates an implicit pressure to mirror that behavior. You start to wonder if your standard high-performance week looks like "slacking" compared to their 80-hour grind. This can lead to a slow-burn guilt that erodes your actual rest.

### 2. The Tribal Knowledge Trap

When a CTO hasn't taken a day off in over a year, they become the sole keeper of vital information. This creates a "single point of failure." Total dedication often accidentally prevents the creation of robust processes because the team gets used to the founder just "handling it" whenever a problem arises.

### 3. The Risk of Diminishing Returns

There is a point where working harder stops meaning working better. When you never step away from the keyboard, you lose the "forest for the trees" perspective. Some of the best architectural breakthroughs happen during a hike or a full night's sleep, things that an "always-on" schedule doesn't always allow for.

## Final Thoughts

Working with founders this dedicated is a double-edged sword. It offers a masterclass in execution and a front-row seat to building a company from the ground up. However, it requires the rest of the team to be disciplined about their own boundaries.

At a startup like Shiboleth.ai, the mission is huge, and the work is intense. The goal is to make sure that while the founders are sprinting a marathon, the engineers are building the sustainable systems that will keep the company running for the long haul.
